# LANGUAGE: Programming Foundation

## About
Welcome! I am passionate about programming and building a strong foundation for a great future in cybersecurity. This repo showcases my learning journey through organized folders of study notes, exercised questions, and mini projects. This is meant to be ongoing and I wll keep adding new languages as I grow!

## Structure

- **C/**: Mastering low level programming.
  - *Learn/*: Commented snippets for core C concepts (.c files).
  - *Exercise/*: Practice problems to build C skills (.c files).
- **Python/**: Exploring versatile scripting.
  - *Learn/*: Commented snippets for Python basics (.py files).
  - *Exercise/*: Practice problems to hone Python skills (.py files).
  - *Project/*: Mini projects showcasing Python’s capabilities (.py files, see below).
- **Bash/**: Learning Linux automation and system tasks.
  - *Learn/*: Commented snippets for scripting basics (.sh files).
  - *Project/*: Mini projects for practical applications (.sh files, see below).

## Key Projects
Check out my mini projects:

### Python Projects
- `p1.py`: A game where the program generates a number, and the user wins a crown if they guess correctly.
- `p2.py`: Generates a random password.
- `p3.py`: Simulates rolling dice.
- `p4.py`: A rock-paper-scissors game.
- `p5.py`: Generates QR codes for websites.

### Bash Projects
- `p1.sh`: A script that simulates rolling dice and outputs a user ID if any die shows a 6.
- `p2.sh`: Displays a live clock.
- `p3.sh`: Archives large files from a specified path.
- `p4.sh`: Creates a user account with a given name, comments, and an autogenerated password.

## What I’ve Learned
- **C**: Variables, loops, conditionals, functions, arrays, pointers, structures, recursion, file I/O, and dynamic memory allocation for low level programming.
- **Python**: Syntax, data structures (lists, tuples, sets, dictionaries), functions, recursion, file handling, exceptions, and object oriented programming for scripting.
- **Bash**: Shell scripting for Linux, including variables, operators, conditionals, loops, functions, and file redirection, with projects relevant to system administration.

## Clone the Repo
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ratri0git/LANGUAGE.git
```

## Requirements
- **C**: GCC (`sudo apt install gcc` on Linux, MinGW on Windows).
- **Python**: Python 3.x (`sudo apt install python3` on Linux, download from python.org for Windows).
- **Bash**: Bash shell (built-in on Linux, Git Bash/WSL on Windows).

## Running Code
- **C**: `gcc file.c -o output && ./output` (Linux) or `output.exe` (Windows).
- **Python**: `python3 file.py` (Linux) or `python file.py` (Windows).
- **Bash**: `bash file.sh` or `chmod +x file.sh && ./file.sh`.

## Environment
- Built on Linux (e.g., Kali, Ubuntu) for Bash and some C/Python, and Windows for cross-platform testing.
- Tip: Use a Linux VM (e.g., VirtualBox) for a consistent experience.
